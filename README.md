Inspired by playing online games with friends and family during the quarantine season, I made a program that is designed to efficiently keep track of every players' score in any sort of game. 

Features:
The program has several features such as adding and removing players, assigning weighted scores (first place gets 3 points, whereas second place gets 2 points), sorting players based on their scores and printing out a leaderboard and winners of each round, and also an editing feature to correct any mistakes previously made.
